# nativescript-RadSideDrawer

It has a prior login page and then a settings page inside it.

This demo app is here for test an error/issue when developing the app to a real iOS device. It works with Emulators and with a real Android device

The command used is:

```
$ tns run ios --device device_identifier_name
```

Using the command below it's working, but I do not have the realtime control (console.log - errors ...)

```
$ tns run ios --release --device device_identifier_name
```
